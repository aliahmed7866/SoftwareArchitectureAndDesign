# Intro to CodeCarbon 
Codecarbon will report (with limitations) how much Carbon your Python code causes to me emitted when it is run.

See one or more of 
- https://codecarbon.io/
- https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/index.html
- git@github.com:mlco2/codecarbon.git

# Using CodeCarbon for our Examples
The examples require access to codecarbon. To install (see https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/installation.html) you do not need the source but (Linux) can use
`pip install codecarbon` (if you are able/wish to install on a given system)
`pip install --user codecarbon` (to install as a user)

NB on Debian for Python3 use `pip3` in place of `pip`

Debian refers to a type of Linux Distros
